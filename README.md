# Hacker News API

## Getting started

Simply run `docker-compose up` and it will take care of starting the whole stack for you. Elasticsearch and Kibana will be started and NodeJS app will be compiled and started. Application will bind to your local ports 9200, 5601 and 3000.

## API

Server API is documented at [localhost:3000/docs](localhost:3000/docs), after you run the stack. You can try the API directly from there. 

Or navigate to [swagger.yml](assets/swagger.yml).
